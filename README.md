# Book-ED
Book-ed! is a platform that allows a person to find something they are looking for,
within their friend circles and local area. If a person wants to borrow an item, all they need to do is to log on
to your platform and search for it. They can then find lenders around them who have the item and are
willing to lend it. All thatâ€™s left to do is to zero in on the lender based on proximity and acquaintance. The
lender and borrower can then share their details and catch up to do an exchange.

Project is done in Android Studio using Kotlin.
